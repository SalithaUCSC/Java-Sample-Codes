# Serialization and Deserialization

### Serialization

Conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream

### Deserialization

Conversion of the byte stream into the real object

> The byte stream created is platform independent. So, the object serialized on one platform can be deserialized on a different platform.

> To make any object Serializable, corresponding class should be implemented by
 **java.io.Serializable** interface.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Person implements Serializable {

}
```
### Serial Version UID

* JVM associates a version (long) number with each serializable class. <br>
* It is used to **verify** that the saved and loaded objects have the same 
attributes and thus are compatible on serialization.
* This value remains as a **Class Attribute**.
```java
public static final long serialVersionUID = -7377252446219094789L;
```
* This number can be generated automatically by most IDEs and is based on the class name, its attributes and associated access modifiers. 
* Any changes result in a different number and can cause an **InvalidClassException**.
* If a serializable class doesnâ€™t explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the serialization runtime will calculate a default one for that class.
