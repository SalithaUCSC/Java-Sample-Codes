# Data Structures

## Stack

* Organizes data following LIFO(Last In First Out) behavior.
* LIFO - The top most element which was pushed as the last element(LAST IN) will be removed first(FIRST OUT).
* Important two elements are stack **size** and **top index**.
* Important methods are push(), pop(), isFull(), isEmpty().

## Queue

* Organize data following FIFO(First In First Out) behavior.
* FIFO - The element which was inserted first(FIRST IN) is removed first(FIRST OUT).
* Important two elements are stack **rear index** and **front index**.
* Important methods are enqueue(), dequeue(), isFull(), isEmpty().
